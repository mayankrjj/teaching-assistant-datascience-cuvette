Section 6: AI Tools & LLMs
üß† Option A: Prompt Engineering

Prompt Used:

‚ÄúHow can I calculate each country‚Äôs percentage contribution to total sales in Excel when working with a Pivot Table? I want to make sure it doesn‚Äôt break when I refresh the data, and it should work across different country rows automatically.‚Äù

AI Response:

The AI suggested creating a formula using absolute cell references like =B2/$B$30 next to the Pivot Table, ensuring that the denominator (total sales) remains fixed. It also recommended excluding the Grand Total row from conditional formatting and enabling the ‚ÄúPreserve cell formatting on update‚Äù option in Pivot Table settings to prevent formatting loss after refresh.

Reflection:

What did the AI do well?
It offered not just the formula but practical advice on working with Pivot Tables dynamically ‚Äî especially preserving formatting after refresh, which saved time.

What did I have to modify or improve?
I adjusted the cell references to match my specific table layout and fine-tuned the formatting steps for better clarity during walkthrough recording.
