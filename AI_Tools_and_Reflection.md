Prompt used:

‚ÄúCreate a formula in Excel to calculate the % contribution of each country to total sales in a pivot table. Total sales are in column B, grand total is in B30.‚Äù

AI Response:

Use the formula =B2 / $B$30 in the adjacent column to calculate the percentage contribution. Format the result as percentage using the % style. Use absolute reference for the total cell so it doesn‚Äôt change when you drag the formula down.

Reflection:

What did the AI do well?
It gave me a precise, working formula along with contextual tips like using absolute cell references and formatting as percentages.

What did I have to modify or improve?
I adjusted the formula slightly to match my specific cell range and clarified instructions for visual formatting and filtering.
