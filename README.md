## ✅ Section-wise Breakdown

### 1️⃣ Python + Machine Learning
- Dataset: [Student Performance Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
- Cleaned and explored data using `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.
- Engineered a binary target: Pass/Fail.
- Built and evaluated Logistic Regression & Random Forest models.
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, F1-score.
- **Notebook:** `Python_ML.ipynb`

---

### 2️⃣ SQL
- Dataset: [Chinook Database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database)
- SQL Queries include:
  - Top 5 customers by purchase
  - Most popular genre by track sales
  - Managers and their subordinates
  - Most sold album per artist (using CTE + ROW_NUMBER)
  - Monthly sales trends (2013)
- **File:** `Section2_SQL_Chinook_Assignment.sql` with screenshots

---

### 3️⃣ Tableau
- Built interactive visualizations from the Chinook data.
- Dashboards cover:
  - Revenue by Country & Genre
  - Artist-wise sales trends
- **Public Link:** [https://public.tableau.com/views/AirBnBFullProject_17405630156910/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link](#)

### 4️⃣ Excel
- Dataset: [Online Retail Dataset (UCI)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail)
- Cleaned missing data and duplicates
- Created calculated fields (Total Sales, Month)
- Built Pivot Tables to show:
  - Sales by Country and Month
  - % Contribution of each Country
- Used formulas and conditional formatting
- Visualized Monthly Revenue using a line chart
- **File:** `Book1 copy.xlsx`

---

### 5️⃣ AI Tools & LLMs
- Tool used: **ChatGPT**
- Used to:
  - Generate Excel formulas

    - **Prompt Example:**
  > "Create a formula in Excel to calculate the % contribution of each country to total sales in a pivot table. Total sales are in column B, grand total is in B30.”
- **Reflections:**
  - AI helped accelerate problem-solving
  - I still verified and customized logic for accuracy
- **File:** `AI_Tools_and_Reflection.md`

---

### 6️⃣ TA Mindset & Teaching Philosophy
- Explained how I'd support struggling students
- Shared how I’d teach complex topics like Gradient Descent with analogies and visual breakdowns
- **File:** `Teaching_Approach.md`
